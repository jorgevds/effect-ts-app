# Full stack example with Next.js, RSC, Prisma, & Effect-ts

## Plan

-   [x] Dependency injection
-   [ ] Git
-   [ ] Use plain Tailwind to make little app
-   [ ] Make more complex components to show off pipeline capabilities
-   [ ] Model typical domain issues on useful design patterns, such as Option
-   [ ] Custom errors
-   [ ] Schema validation with own error
-   [x] Retry policy
-   [x] Env variables: retry policy in variables, feature flags
-   [x] Logging
-   [ ] writing to file
-   [ ] Observability

### Takeaways

## Pros

-   Splitting up of code between effectful and pure is a meaningful category (heh)
-   Lots of complexity thought out and abstracted
-   Huge suite of tools in a wide range of topics
-   Not overtly front-loaded
-   Majority can be done with the minority of imports
-   pipe-ing functions is a "once you start" kind of addictive programming
-   Encapsulation to the nth degree
-   Production code and test code designed in parallel
-   Community
-   FP is cool and I don't care what the haters say

## Cons

-   Actually front-loaded
-   Verbose
-   Overwhelming breadth of code already
-   Type errors really dense
-   Documentation always leaves a lot to be desired
-   No clear direction on how to actually write code
-   Trending away from pipelines towards generator functions
-   If you know, you know
-   Monads are burritos
